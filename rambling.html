    <p>Ramblings?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>6/1/25, I have created a page for my ramblings here, probably not going to make sense to you viewer, but hopefully it will be entertaining to read.

    <p>6/8/25, Man im so sick and tired of the bullshit I put up with on the daily on this shitty platform. Constantly its about " me me me ". All I want to do is chill with my buddies and drink some good beer, talk about what they're doing, support them, without trauma dumping continuously for days at a time. I try to give someone advice, and immediately I am interrupted. Holy shit why are people like this?</p>
